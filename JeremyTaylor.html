<p class="Heading #2 (2)">Foreword</p>
    <p class="Body text (2)">The scientific soul of our brave new world began in the early seventeenth century with its new approaches to reality, but its evolution and modern prejudices are distinctively its own. In the age of Milton and Bacon neither the Word of God nor the words of man were in any doubt of their ontological significance, although biblical and scientific reality were beginning to be separate. Today, however, there is a crisis in the concept and understanding of language itself, comparable to the philosophical problem at the turn of this century concerning the foundation of mathematics; now confusion reigns before the completion of our Babel, and tells of our incapacity to express in words humanity&#x2019;s innermost truths, sensory experiences, moral and transcendent intuitions. &#x201C;Political rhetoric,&#x201D; says one modern critic of our times, &#x201C;the tidal mendacity of journalism and the mass media, the trivializing cant of public and socially approved modes of discourse, have made of almost everything modern urban men and women say or hear or read an empty jargon, a cancerous loquacity. . . . Language has lost the very capacity for truth, for political or personal honesty. It has marketed and mass- marketed its mysteries of prophetic intuition . .. and operates, self- doubtingly, on the sharp edge of silence. We know now that if the Word &#x2018;was in the beginning,&#x2019; it can also be at the end: that there is a vocabulary and a grammar of the death camps, that thermo-nuclear detonations can be designated as &#x2018;Operation Sunshine.&#x2019; It were as if the quintessential, the identifying attribute of man&#x2014;the Logos, the organon of language&#x2014;had broken in our mouths.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="Body text (2)">fill pastor,&#x201D;<sup>2</sup> is relevant to our atheistic and deconstructionist times, not because he lived in a century that resembled ours in its political, religious and philosophical upheavals, but because in that age of <i>scoffers, walking after their own lusts</i> (2 Peter 3:3), he lived and moved and had his being (cf. Acts 17:28) in the eternal Word of God, made new by the scriptural zeal of the Reformers, and renewed still more by their zeal for the vernacular:</p>
<p class="Body text (2)">By the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</p>
<p class="Body text (2)">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, preserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly man. .. .</p>
<p class="Body text (2)">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up... .</p>
<p class="Body text (2)">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness (2 Peter 3:5-13).</p>
    <p class="Body text (2)">This biblical view of the world was given this fresh and sonorous expression when the Authorized Version of the scriptures, commonly called The King James Bible, was published in Taylor&#x2019;s native town of Cambridge, some two years before his birth in 1613. Like the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate this new translation was more <i>begotten</i> than <i>made,</i> and being the consequence of a rare conjunction of circumstances, renewed biblical faith, Renaissance learning and Elizabethan English, must remain in the English language <i>the</i> primary text of God&#x2019;s Word.</p>
    <p class="Body text (2)">Mastery of Hebrew, Greek and Latin, the Renaissance legacy to the schools of England, made this translation traditional in content, not just melodious in cadence, and facilitated that <i>appeal to tradition</i> that is</p>

<p class="Body text (2)">more distinctive of Anglicanism than either the <i>sola scriptura</i> of the Reformers, or the <i>fides quaerens intellectum</i> of the Romans, in their doctrinal formulations at Trent. Nevertheless, scripture, tradition and reason were there and then so combined that there emerged not only a renewal of patristic tradition in the vernacular, but a theology that was distinctively spiritual and pastoral:</p>
<p class="Body text (2)">High speculations are as barren as the tops of cedars; but the fundamentals of Christianity are fruitful as the valleys or the creeping vine. For know, that it is no meditation, but it may be an illusion, when you consider mysteries to become more learned, without thoughts of improving piety. ... It was a saying of Aegidius, &#x201C;that an old and a simple woman, if she loves Jesus, may be greater than was brother Bonaventure.&#x201D; Want of learning and disability to consider great secrets of theology, do not at all retard our progress to spiritual perfections.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p class="Body text (2)">The death of Jeremy Taylor in 1667 more or less concluded this formative period of Anglicanism that began around 1595 with Richard Hooker and was distinguished by such names as Lancelot Andrewes and William Laud in England, Arnold Ussher and John Bramhall in Ireland, and a host of others generally known as the Caroline divines. These Carolines, Catholics in a new culture and language, were theologians in the tradition of John, the Divine; by fitting their words to the Word of God, and molding them for worship and prayer, they gave a new quality to the English language, making it as apt as Hebrew, Greek and Latin had been made through liturgical usage to express the realities of grace and the sanctuary. Like Chrysostom in Greek, and Augustine in Latin, Taylor in English is of the same sacramental tradition in word and symbol, recognizing the real presence of the transcendent in true theological discourse, and the sheer emptiness of mere intellectual debate:</p>

<p class="Body text (2)">better learn by love than by enquiry. ... If he will .. . pass through the mystery with great devotion and purest simplicity, and converse with the purities of the sacrament frequently and with holy intention, this man shall understand more by his experience than the greatest clerks can by all their subtilties, the commentaries of the doctors and the glosses of inquisitive men. &#x201C;The love of the Lord,&#x201D; saith the wise man, &#x201C;passeth all things for illumination.&#x201D;<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p class="Body text (2)">Here one can sense the symbolic language of the ancients, which the biblical words of the Greek and Latin Fathers made sacramental; deadened by the definitions of the later schoolmen, it was revitalized by the Anglican appeal to tradition, and given fresh expression by the Carolines in their Elizabethan prose. This period, rich in faith and utterance, is of significance today in a world where the Word of God and the words of men are in crisis; it is of particular importance for modern spiritual writers, preachers and theologians, since the Roman Church by its recent acceptance of the vernacular has made English more widespread as a theological and liturgical language. Taylor was of this time of theological renewal in Word and words, but his concept of theology and spirituality is classical and transcends time: &#x201C;From meditation man rises to devotion, and mental prayer, and intercourse with God; and after that, he rests in the bosom of beatitude and is swallowed up with the comprehensions of love and contemplation.&#x201D;<sup>5</sup></p>
    <p class="Body text (2)">This growth in Catholic tradition came to bloom as the new world, English-speaking and scientific, began to dawn on each side of the Atlantic Ocean, and blossomed throughout the centuries into a spirituality, scriptural and liturgical, ecclesial and personal, that though now in the autumn of its life, is still a living source for a second spring.</p>
    <p class="Body text (2)">The despair of modern man before the limitations of his own empty words can be heard in the final cry of Schoenberg&#x2019;s <i>Moses und Aron:</i> &#x201C;O Word, O Word, which is lacking to me.&#x201D;<sup>6</sup> Nor indeed can the Christian in this post-Christian age be content with the <i>mysterium tremendum</i> of God&#x2019;s substantive absence from a new solitude of man. <i>Lord, to -whom shall we go</i> (John 6:68), remains the pathetic plea of God&#x2019;s</p>

<p class="Body text (2)">chosen and faithful people, for they still believe, even in this world where words have lost their meaning, that their Lord and he alone <i>has the words of eternal life</i> (John 6:68). &#x201C;Christ,&#x201D; said John XXIII in his opening speech at the Second Vatican Council, &#x201C;is ever resplendent as the center of history and of life.&#x201D;</p>
    <p class="Body text (2)">This proclamation of faith in Christ, &#x201C;the Word made Flesh&#x201D; (John 1:14), is the Church&#x2019;s only hope as she journeys through a secular world and dialogues with her deconstructionist critics, who seek to &#x201C;ruin the Sacred Truths.&#x201D;<sup>7</sup> Furthermore, this vision of faith confers on the words of scripture and tradition the timeless quality of the Eternal Word: &#x201C;We have heard the words,&#x201D; said Augustine, &#x201C;but now let us seek the Word.&#x201D; Taylor&#x2019;s language has this timeless quality, and his words mellifluously flowing from image to image, and &#x201C;falling faintly . .. faintly falling&#x201D; from cadence to cadence tell of that Eternal Word, which he heard a) in creation, the first sacrament of the Word; b) in Christ, the Word made flesh; c) in scripture, the Word made text; and d) in man, the flesh made Word. Lie is at all times a poet and preacher of this Word and its presence in his words <i>charms ever so wisely</i> (Psalm 58:5) man&#x2019;s inner ear:</p>
<p class="Body text (2)">There is in the things of God to them which practice them a deliciousness that makes us love them, and that love admits us into God&#x2019;s cabinet, and strangely clarifies the understanding by the purification of the heart. For when our reason is raised up by the Spirit of Christ, it is turned quickly into experience; when our faith relies upon the principles of Christ, it is changed into vision. And so long as we know God only in the ways of man, by contentious learning, by arguing and dispute, we see nothing but the shadow of Flim, and in that shadow we meet with many dark appearances, little certainty, and much &#x0027; conjecture. But when we know Him with the eyes of holiness, and the intuition of gracious experience, with a quiet spirit and the peace of enjoyment, then we shall hear what we never heard and see what our eyes never saw; then the mysteries of godliness shall be opened unto us, and clear as the windows of the mornine.<sup>8</sup></p>
